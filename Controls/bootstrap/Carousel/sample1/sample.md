## Sample 1: Basic Carousel

Carousel images have to be placed inside the `SlidesTemplate` property. It is a control default property so you can place the `<bs:CarouselItem>` elements directly
inside the `<bs:Carousel>` control. Each image is defined using the `CarouselItem` control.

The `CarouselItem` has the `IsActive` that specifies which image will be displayed first.
