### Sample 2: Carousel Settings

The `Carousel` control has the following properties:

* The `RenderSideControls` property speciefies whether the left and right controls which switch the slides will be rendered.

* The `EnableAnimation` property specifies whether the transitions between slides are animated or not.

* The `AutoSlideInterval` property sets the interval of automatic transitions in seconds. If this property is not set, the user has to switch the slides manually.
