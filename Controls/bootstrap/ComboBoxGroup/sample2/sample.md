## Sample 2: Enabled, Visible and EmptyItemText

The `EmptyItemText` property is used to set text of an empty item. The empty item has a value of *null*.

It is also possible to enable / disable the `ComboBoxGroup` control with the `Enabled` property.

To show / hide the `ComboBoxGroup` control the `Visible` property can be used.
