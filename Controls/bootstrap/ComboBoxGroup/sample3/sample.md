### Sample 3: Object Binding

You can also bind the `DataSource` property to a collection of complex objects. 
The text which will be then shown inside the combo box for all items is taken from a property 
of that complex item with name specified in the `DisplayMember` property. 
Returned value of selected item is taken from a property of that item with name specified in the `ValueMember` property.
