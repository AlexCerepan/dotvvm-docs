### Sample 1: Fluid Container

The Container has the `Type` property which specifies the behavior of the Container for large page sizes.

The `Normal` type limits the maximum page width. If the window is wider, the content is not resized beyond the maximum width and it is centered.

The `Fluid` type always utilizes the available horizontal space.
