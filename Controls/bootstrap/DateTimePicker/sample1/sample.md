### Sample 1: Basic Usage

Use the `SelectedDate` property to get or set the selected date.

The `DateTimePicker` can be switched into three different modes using the `Mode` property: `DateTime`, `Date` and `Time`. 

The `FormatString` property specifies the format that will be used to display selected date. Use [standard](https://msdn.microsoft.com/library/az4se3k1%28v=vs.100%29.aspx?f=255&MSPPError=-2147217396) or 
[custom](https://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/8kb3ddd4(v=vs.100).aspx) .NET date format strings.

The language of the calendar and the first day of week is specified by the request culture. You can find more info in the [Globalization](/docs/tutorials/basics-globalization/{branch}) tutorial.
