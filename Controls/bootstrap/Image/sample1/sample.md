## Sample 1: Basic Image

The most important property is the `ImageUrl` which sets the _src_ attribute of the rendered image.

The `Image` control has the `ToolTip`, `AlternateText`, `Width` and `Height` properties which set the _title_, _alt_, width and a height of the image.
The width and height is applied using inline CSS styles.
