### Sample 3: Data-binding

The `DataSource` property can be used to generate the items from an *IEnumerable* in the viewmodel.

Then you can use the following properties which tell the control what property of the collection item will be used:

* `TextBinding`
* `BadgeBinding`
* `ColorBinding`
* `NavigateUrlBinding`
* `IsDisabledBinding`
* `IsSelectedBinding`
* `ClickBinding`
