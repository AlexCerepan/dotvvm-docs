The `NavigationItem` control has the `NavigateUrl` property which specifies target URL, or the `Click` property which invokes a command on the viewmodel.

The `Text` property defines the contents of the item. Alternatively, you can also place the contents inside the control.

The `IsSelected` and `IsDisabled` properties define whether the control gets the active or disabled CSS classes.
