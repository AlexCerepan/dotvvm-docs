## Sample 2: Popover Placement

The `Popover` control has also the `Placement` property. Use this property to specify on which side the overlay appears.

When the `AutoPlacement` property is set to *true*, it will dynamically reorient the popover. 
For example, if the `Placement` property is set to *Left*, the popover will display to the left when possible, otherwise it will display on the right.
