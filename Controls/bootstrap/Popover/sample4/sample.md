### Sample 4: Popover animation, delay and container

The `Popover` control uses by default a CSS fade transition. It is possible to not apply it with the `Animation` property set to *false*.

The `Delay` property is used to delay showing and hiding of the popover (value represents number of milliseconds).

The `Container` property specifies the selector for an element in which the popover is created. It allows to position the popover in the flow of the document 
near the triggering element which will prevent the popover from floating away from the triggering element during a window resize.
