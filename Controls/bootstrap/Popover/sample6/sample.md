### Sample 6: Popover template

The `Popover` control can also use custom popover widget. It needs to be specified within `PopoverTemplate`.

Content of the `Title` property is inserted into element with *popover-title* class, content of the `Content` property into element with *popover-content* class. 
Element with *arrow* class becomes the popover's arrow. All these elements need to be wrapped inside element with *popover* class.
