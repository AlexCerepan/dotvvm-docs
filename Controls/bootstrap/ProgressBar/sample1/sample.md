## Sample 1: Basic Progress Bar

The `ProgressBar` control has `Value` property that sets value of current progress.
Contextual color of `ProgressBar` can be set with `Color` property.

To show `ProgressBar` custom text or label, place it inside the control. Default label is blank.

It is also possible to have hidden label in progress bar with `HiddenTemplate` element.
