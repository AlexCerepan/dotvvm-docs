### Sample 1: Basic Usage

Each link in Responsive navigation is represented by NavigationItem. The `HeaderText` property stores text that will be placed in the Header section of ResponsiveNavigation control. If the `HeaderLinkUrl` property is set than the header section of ResponsiveNavigation will link to the selected URL.

NOTE: For more information about NavigationItems see [NavigationItem documentation](/docs/controls/bootstrap/NavigationItem/{branch}).
