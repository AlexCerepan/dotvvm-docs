### Sample 1: Basic Usage

Each link in Responsive navigation is represented by NavigationItem.  
For more information about NavigationItems see [NavigationItem documentation](../docs/controls/bootstrap/NavigationItem).

The `HeaderText` property stores text that will be placed in the Header section of ResponsibleNavigation control.
If the `HeaderLinkUrl` property is set than the header section of ResponsiveNavigation will link to the selected URL.
