### Sample 2: Advanced ResponsiveNavigation

If the `HeaderImageUrl` is set, the header section will render the image and the value of the `HeaderText` property will be used for the alternate text of the image.

The `IsInverted` property can switch the navbar to the inverse colors.

The `IsStaticTop` property controls whether the `ResponsiveNavigation` is full-width navbar that scrolls away with the page. 
It also removes the left, right and top border to make it look better at the top of the page.
