### Sample 2: Advanced ResponsiveNavigation

If the `HeaderImageUrl` is set, than the header section will contain that image and `HeaderText` will be used as alternate text for this image.

The `IsInverted` property controls style of ResponsiveNavigation.
The `IsStaticTop` property controls if the ResponsiveNavigation is full-width navbar that scrolls away with the page. It removes the left, right and top border so that it looks better at the top of the page if set to *true*.
