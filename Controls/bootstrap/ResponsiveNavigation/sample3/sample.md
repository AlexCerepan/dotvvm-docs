### Sample 3: Fixed ResponsiveNavigation and Alignment

The `ResponsiveNavigation` has also the `FixedTo` property which controls whether the navbar is fixed to *Top* or *Bottom* of the screen, or fixed to *Nothing* (which is the default value).

The items inside the `ResponsiveNavigation` can also be aligned to the left or right side by placing the items into the `LeftAlignedItemsTemplate` and `RightAlignedItemsTemplate` properties.   
If you need to use other items than [NavigationItem](/docs/controls/bootstrap/NavigationItsm/{branch}) (e.g. the [DropDownButton](/docs/controls/bootstrap/DropDownButton/{branch}), 
you have to place them in the `LeftAlignedItemsTemplate` or `RightAlignedItemsTemplate` element.
