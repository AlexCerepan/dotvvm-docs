## Sample 4: DropDownButton and Form Controls in ResponsiveNavigation

You can also use other control inside the `ResponsiveNavigation` control.
You have to place them in the  `LeftAlignedItemsTemplate` or `RightAlignedItemsTemplate` elements.

There are some limitations of the Bootstrap navbar. For example, we don't recommend to use the `Label` properties on the `<bs:Form>` because it won't render correctly.
