### Sample 4: Other elements than NavigationItems in ResponsiveNavigation

You can also put other elements than NavigationItems into ResponsiveNavigation.
Just make sure to put them inside  `LeftAlignedItemsTemplate` or `RightAlignedItemsTemplate`.

When you want to use `<bs:Form>` inside ResponsiveNavigation don't set Label. When Label is set the ResponsiveNavigation would not render correctly.
