### Sample 5: Responsiveness

It's possible to collapse the `ResponsiveNavigation` into a single button when the content cannot fit the screen. 

To do so, you have to the change the value of the `AllowCollapsingToButton` property to *true*.

Optionally, you can set your own content of the collapsed button by placing in into the `CollapsedButtonTemplate` template. 
If the `CollapsedButtonTemplate` is not set, the standard button with three stripes will be rendered.
