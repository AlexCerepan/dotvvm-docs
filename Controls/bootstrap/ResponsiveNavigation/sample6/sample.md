### Sample 6: ResponsiveNavigation Data-Binding

The `ResponsiveNavigation` can be also used with the `DataSource` property to generate the menu items from the collection.

The `TextBinding` property specifies which property of the collection items will be used as the text of the menu item.

The `NavigateUrlBinding` property specifies which property will be used as the URL of the hyperlink.

You can also use the `IsDisabledBinding` to specify which property controls whether the menu item is disabled or enabled.

Also, there is the `IsSelectedBinding` property which controls whether the menu item is selected.
