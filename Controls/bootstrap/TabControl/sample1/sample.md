### Sample 1: Basic TabControl

Each tab is represented by [TabItem](/docs/controls/bootstrap/TabItem).

Header and main content of each `TabItem` is defined in it`s `HeaderTemplate` and `ContentTemplate` properties.  

The `IsActive` property controls whether the tab will be defaultly selected.   
When no tab has `IsActive` property set to true, than the first tab will be set as active.
