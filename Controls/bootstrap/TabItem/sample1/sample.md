### Sample 1: TabItem Control

Header and main content of each `TabItem` is defined in it`s `HeaderTemplate` and `ContentTemplate` properties.  

The `IsActive` property controls whether the tab will be defaultly selected.

`TabItems` are items of [TabControl](/docs/controls/bootstrap/TabControl) and not work outside it.
