### Sample 1: Basic Thumbnail

The Thumbnail control has the same properties for working with image as [Image](../docs/controls/bootstrap/Image/{branch})  control.  
Additionaly it has `NavigateUrl` property which specifies URL of the page where the link goes to.

The `CaptionTemplate` of the Thumbnail control contains content for the caption used for thumbnail.
