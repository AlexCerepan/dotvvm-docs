## Sample 1: ButtonGroup Size

The `Size` property specifies the sizing of the buttons. The available sizes are: `Default`, `Small` and `Large`.

Be sure to use the `<bs:Button>` instead of the `<dot:Button>` controls inside the button group. 

You can also use `<bs:DropDownButton>`, `<bs:ButtonGroupCheckBox>` or `<bs:ButtonGroupRadioButton>` inside.
