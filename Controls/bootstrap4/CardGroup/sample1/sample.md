## Sample 1: Card Group Types

Use `Type` property to switch between different layouts of cards.

Possible values are:
* *Group* - Cards are rendered right next to each other and have equal size.
* *Deck* - Set of equal sized cards that are not attached to each other.
* *Columns* - Cards are organized into columns. Cards with different sizes are supported and will form mosaic-like pattern.
