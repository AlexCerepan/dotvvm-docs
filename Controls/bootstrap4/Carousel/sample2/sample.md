## Sample 2: Carousel Settings

The `Carousel` control has the following properties:

* The `Animation` property specifies which transitions between slides should be used - `Slide`, `Fade` or `None`.

* The `AutoSlideInterval` property sets the interval of automatic transitions in seconds. If this property is not set, the user has to switch the slides manually.

* The `RenderSideControls` property specifies whether the left and right controls which switch the slides will be rendered.

* The `RenderIndicators` property specifies whether the bottom active slide indicators should be rendered.

* The `PauseOnHover` property indicates whether the animation should be paused when the mouse cursor is over the carousel.

* The `CycleItems` property specifies whether the animation should continue when it reaches the last slide.
