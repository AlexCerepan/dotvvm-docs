## Sample 1: Normal vs Fluid Container

The `Type` property specifies the behavior of the `Container` for wide pages.

* `Normal` type limits the maximum page width. If the window is wider, the content is not resized beyond the maximum width and it is centered.
* `Fluid` type always utilizes the available horizontal space.
