## Sample 2: Binding MediaList

Items inside the `MediaList` control can be also generated from a collection in the `DataSource` property.

You can specify, which properties of collection items will be used to set properties of generated media objects:

+ `ImageUrlBinding`
+ `AlternateTextBinding`
+ `NavigateUrlBinding`
+ `WidthBinding`
+ `HeightBinding`
+ `HeaderTextBinding`
+ `DescriptionBinding`
