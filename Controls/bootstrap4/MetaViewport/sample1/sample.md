## Sample 1: MetaViewport

Place the control inside the `head` element. It uses Bootstrap API to control zooming and presentation on mobile devices.

The `MetaViewport` control has the `Width` property which sets the width of the page.

The `InitialScale` property is used to set initial zoom level which is applied when the page is first loaded.
The `MaximumScale` property defines maximum zoom level the user can set.

It is also possible to disable zooming at all with the `IsUserScalable` property.
