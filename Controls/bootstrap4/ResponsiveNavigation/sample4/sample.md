## Sample 4: DropDownButton and Form Controls in ResponsiveNavigation

Except of the `NavigationItem` controls, you can also use [Form](/docs/controls/bootstrap4/Form/{branch}) and [DropDownButton](/docs/controls/bootstrap4/DropDownButton/{branch}) controls inside the navigation bar.

You have to place them in the  `LeftAlignedItemsTemplate` or `RightAlignedItemsTemplate` elements.

There are some limitations of the Bootstrap navbar. For example, the `Form` control `Type` must be set to `Inline` mode.
