## Sample 5: Responsiveness

It's possible to collapse the `ResponsiveNavigation` into a single button when the content cannot fit the screen. 

The `MaximumScreenSizeBeforeCollapse` specifies the maximum screen size in which the navbar should be collapsed. Default is `Medium`.

Optionally, you can set your own content of the collapsed button by placing in into the `CollapsedButtonTemplate` template. 
If the `CollapsedButtonTemplate` is not set, the standard button with three stripes will be rendered.
