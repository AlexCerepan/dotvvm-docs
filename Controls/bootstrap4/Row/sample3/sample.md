## Sample 3: Horizontal Alignment

The `JustifyContent` property allows to specify horizontal alignment for all screen sizes. 

There are also `JustifyContentSM`, `JustifyContentMD`, `JustifyContentLG` and `JustifyContentXL` to specify the behavior for particular screen sizes.

* `Start` aligns the columns to the left.
* `Center` aligns the columns to the middle.
* `End` aligns the columns to the right.
* `Around` distributes the remaining space equally around every column.
* `Between` distributes the remaining space equally in the gaps between columns.

See the diagram in [Bootstrap Grid documentation](<https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.1/layout/grid/#horizontal-alignment>).
