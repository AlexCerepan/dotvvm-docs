## Sample 1: Basic TabControl

Each tab is represented by the [TabItem](/docs/controls/bootstrap4/TabItem/{branch}) control.

The header and content of each `TabItem` is defined using the `HeaderTemplate` and `ContentTemplate` properties.  

The `IsActive` property specifies whether the tab is currently selected or not.

The tab can be disabled by setting its `Enabled` property to `false`.
