## Sample 1: Basic Toast

The header content of Toast can be set be one of two ways, by `HeaderText` property or by using `HeaderTemplate`.  
The main content can be set by `Text` or by `ContentTemlate`.  
It`s not required to provide both header and content, but at least one required is.

Showing / hidding of Toast is done using `IsDisplayed` property.
