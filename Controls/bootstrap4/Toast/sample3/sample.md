## Sample 3: Hiding

The default way for hiding `Toast` is the [CloseButton](/docs/controls/bootstrap4/CloseButton/{branch}) which is automatically created in header.

You can remove the default [CloseButton](/docs/controls/bootstrap4/CloseButton/{branch}) by setting `AddCloseButton` to *false*.

An alternative way for hiding the `Toast` is by setting the `AutoHideDelay` property. The delay is in seconds.
