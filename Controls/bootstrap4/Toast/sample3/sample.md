## Sample 3: Hiding

Default way how to hide Toast is by [CloseButton](/docs/controls/bootstrap4/CloseButton/{branch}) which is automatically generated into header.

Automatic adding of [CloseButton](/docs/controls/bootstrap4/CloseButton/{branch}) can be disabled by setting `AddCloseButton` to *false*.

Alternative way how to hide Toast is by setting `AutoHideDelay` property.  
`AutoHideDelay` property represents number (double) in seconds. And can be set to null when we want want auto hide functionality.
