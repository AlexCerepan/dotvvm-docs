## Sample 2: Dismissible Alert

If you want to allow the user to hide the alert, use the `IsDismissible` property. When `IsDismissible` property is set to true, a close button will be rendered.

The `IsDismissed` property gets or sets if the alert is dismissed. You can use data-binding on it to determine whether the user has dismissed the alert or not.

The `Dismissed` event is called after the alert is dismissed.
