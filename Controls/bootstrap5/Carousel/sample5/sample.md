## Sample 5: Carousel DataSource

The `Carousel` slides can also be loaded from a collection in the viewmodel. Use the `DataSource` property to specify the source collection.

Then use the `ItemImageUrl` to specify which property of the collection item will be used as the URL of the image. 

Similarly, the `ItemCaption` specifies which property will be the slide caption. Alternatively, you can use `ItemCaptionTemplate` property to define a custom template for slide captions.

The `ItemImageAlternateText` to specify which property of the collection item will be used as ImageAlternateTex.

Finally, the `ItemDelay` to specify the property which will be used as the delay of the Image.
