## Sample 3: Column Ordering

To specify explicit column order, use the `OrderAll` property.

To override the value for a particular screen size, use `OrderSmall`, `OrderMedium`, `OrderLarge`, `OrderXLarge` and `OrderXXLarge` properties.

Includes support for `1` through `5` across all six screen sizes. There are also responsive `first` and `last` values that set position of column to first or last position.
