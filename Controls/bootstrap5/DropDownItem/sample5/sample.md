## Sample 3: dropdown close behavior

You can specify the dropdown menu close `CloseBehavior`:
* `Default` - the dropdown menu is closed when some item is selected, or the user clicks outside
* `Inside` - the dropdown menu is not closed after clicking on the item but closes when the user clicks outside
* `Outside` - the dropdown menu is not closed when the user clicks outside but closes after clicking on the item
* `Manual` - the dropdown menu is not closed when the user clicks outside or after clicking on the item
