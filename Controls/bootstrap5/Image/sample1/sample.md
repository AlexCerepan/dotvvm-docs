## Sample 1: Basic Image

The most important property is the `ImageUrl` which sets the `src` attribute of the rendered image.

The `Image` control has the `ToolTip` and `AlternateText` properties which set the `title` and `alt` attributes.

There are also `Width` and `Height` properties which apply the width and a height of the image using inline CSS styles.
