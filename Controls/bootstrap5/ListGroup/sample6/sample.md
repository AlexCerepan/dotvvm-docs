## Sample 6: Group types

Set `GroupType` as `Flush` to remove some borders and rounded corners to render list group items edge-to-edge in a parent container (e.g., cards). Set `GroupType` as `Numbered` to opt into numbered list group items.

**Flush mode cannot be combined with horizontal `ListGroup`**
