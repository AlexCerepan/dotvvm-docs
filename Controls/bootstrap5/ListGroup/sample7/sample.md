## Sample 7: Orientation and responsibility

The `Orientation` property controls whether the ListGroup would be `Horizontal` or `Vertical`.

When using `Horizontal` ListGroup, than we can also use `ForceVerticalOrientationBreakpoint` to set when the ListGroup should change from `Horizontal` to `Vertical`.  
If set to `None` than the ListGroup will never change to `Vertical`.
