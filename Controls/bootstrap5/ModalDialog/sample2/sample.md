## Sample 2: ModalDialog Closing

Control `ModalDialog` contains `closeOnBackdropClick` and `closeOnEscape` properties which allows to specify whether the dialog should be closed by clicking outside of it or by pressing the Escape key. Both properties are set to true by default.

If `AddCloseButton` is set to `true`, the `CloseButton` control will be added to the modal dialog header.
