## Sample 5: Navigation Placement and Items Positions

The navigation control has a few options how to be placed:

* `Default` the navigation has a static position
* `FixedTop` the navigation is fixed to the top
* `FixedBottom` the navigation is fixed on the bottom
* `StickyTop` scrolls with the page until it reaches the top, then stays there
* `StickyBottom` scrolls with the page until it reaches the bottom, then stays there

`NavBar` property `Justify` allows adding a flex CSS utility class to position the navigation items in a specific way.
