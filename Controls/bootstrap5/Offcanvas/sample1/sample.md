## Sample 1: Placement

Offcanvas is a sidebar component that can be toggled to appear from the `Left`, `Right`, `Top`, or `Bottom` edge of the viewport by property `Placement`. 

Required property to work with `Offcanvas` is property `IsCollapsed`, which is `true` when offcanvas is hidden and `false` when is shown.
