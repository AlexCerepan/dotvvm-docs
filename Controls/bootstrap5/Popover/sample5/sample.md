## Sample 5: Allowing HTML in Title and Content

If you want to allow HTML in `Title` and `Content` properties, you must turn it on explicitly using the `AllowHtmlInTitleAndContent` property.

> If you allow HTML in popovers, make sure the HTML is safe to display. See [Cross-site scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) for more information.
