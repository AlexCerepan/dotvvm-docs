## Sample 2: Gutters

By default, columns in Bootstrap rows use gutters to preserve space between them. The gutters can be disabled by the `{preffix}Gutter{suffix}` property, where suffix can be `All`, `Small`, `Medium`, `Large`, `XLarge` or `XXLarge` based on window size and preffix can be `Horizontal` or `Vertical` for gutter direction.
