## Sample 3: Justify content (Horizontal Alignment)

Use `Flex.JustifyContentAll` property on flexbox containers to change the alignment of flex items on the main axis for all screen sizes.

There are also `Flex.JustifyContentSmall`, `Flex.JustifyContentMedium`, `Flex.JustifyContentLarge`, `Flex.JustifyContentXLarge` and `Flex.JustifyContentXXLarge` to specify the behavior for particular screen sizes.

* `None` aligns the columns by defaultt.
* `Start` aligns the columns to the left.
* `Center` aligns the columns to the middle.
* `End` aligns the columns to the right.
* `Around` distributes the remaining space equally in the gaps between columns. Items have a half-size space on either end.
* `Between` distributes the remaining space equally in the gaps between columns. The first item is flush with the start, the last is flush with the end.
* `Evenly` distributes the remaining space equally in the gaps between columns. Items have equal space around them.
