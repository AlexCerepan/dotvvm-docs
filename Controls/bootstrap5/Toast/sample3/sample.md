## Sample 3: Hiding

The default way for hiding `Toast` is the [CloseButton](~/controls/bootstrap5/CloseButton) which is automatically created in header.

You can remove the default [CloseButton](~/controls/bootstrap5/CloseButton) by setting `AddCloseButton` to *false*.

An alternative way for hiding the `Toast` is by setting the `AutoHideDelay` property. The delay is in miliseconds.
