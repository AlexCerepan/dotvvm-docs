## Sample 4: Allowing HTML in Text

If you want to allow HTML in the `Text` property, you must turn it on explicitly using the `AllowHtml` property.

> If you allow HTML in tooltips, make sure the HTML is safe to display. See [Cross-site scripting](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-site_scripting) for more information.
