## Sample 6: Responding to changes and enabling properties

You can use the `Changed-*` and `Enabled-*` property groups to specify commands triggered when the user changes the value, and to specify whether the field is editable.

There is also `Visible-*` property group which guides the field visibility, and `Label-*` property group which can override property labels.
