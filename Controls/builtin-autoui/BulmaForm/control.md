Generates a form for the object in the current [binding context](~/pages/concepts/data-binding/binding-context) based on [DotVVM Auto UI model metadata](~/pages/concepts/auto-ui/metadata).

This control renders HTML and CSS compatible with [Bulma](https://bulma.io/). Even if you don't use this CSS framework, the control may be useful to you as it generates a clean hierarchy of `div` elements marked with easily styleable CSS classes.

There are also other versions of this control which produce HTML and CSS classes expected by popular CSS frameworks: 

* [BulmaForm](./BulmaForm) for [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) 

* [Form](./Form) - table-based form layout without any CSS framework
