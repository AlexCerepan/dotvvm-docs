Generates a form for the object in the current [binding context](~/pages/concepts/data-binding/binding-context) based on [DotVVM Auto UI model metadata](~/pages/concepts/auto-ui/metadata).

This control renders table-based form which works for the basic scenarios and doesn't require many CSS styling.

There are also other versions of this control which produce HTML and CSS classes expected by popular CSS frameworks: 

* [BootstrapForm](./BootstrapForm) for [Bootstrap 5](https://getbootstrap.com/) 

* [BulmaForm](./BulmaForm) for [Bulma](https://bulma.io/)
