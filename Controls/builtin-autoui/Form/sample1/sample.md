## Sample 1: Basic Form

The `DataContext` property set on the form or its closest ancestor defines the object for which the form will be auto-generated.

The [model metadata](~/pages/concepts/auto-ui/metadata) or conventions set in [Auto UI configuration](~/pages/concepts/auto-ui/overview) are used to determine how the editing control for each property will be generated.
