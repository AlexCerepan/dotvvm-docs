## Sample 1: Auto-generating GridView columns

The Auto UI `GridViewColumns` control looks at the properties of the object bound to the `DataSource` property and auto-generates columns for them. Basically, this column will be replaced by the generated columns.

You can add additional columns before or after this column.
