## Sample 3: Button Types

The Button control has the `ButtonTagName` property which specifies the tag rendered by the button.  
Pass either **input** (*<input ... />*) or **button** (*<button ... />*) values.

You can also choose whether it is a submit button or a normal button using the `IsSubmitButton` property.
