`PlaceHolder` is a virtual control that doesn't render anything - it can only contain its children.  

> The control is not meant to be used in DotHTML markup - it helps the control developers to use multiple controls on a place where only one `DotvvmControl` is assumed, or to use it as an empty control with no output.
