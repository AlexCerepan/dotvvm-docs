## Sample 2: Dismiss

The `AllowDismiss` property will add an icon to the right side of the alert, allowing the user to hide the alert. The `Dismissed` command is triggered when the alert is hidden by user.

The `DismissIcon` can be used to specify custom dismiss icon.

You can also use the `AutoHideTimeout` property  to hide the alert automatically after being displayed for specified number of seconds. The `Dismissed` command is not triggered in this case.
