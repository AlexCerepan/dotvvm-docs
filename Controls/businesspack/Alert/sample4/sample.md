### Sample 4: Display State

You can use the `IsDisplayed` property to determine or specify, whether the alert is displayed.

If you set this property to `true`, the alert will be displayed. When the alert is hidden, the property will be switched to `false`.

If the `IsDisplayed` property is not set, the alert is displayed whenever the `Text` is not `null` or empty.
