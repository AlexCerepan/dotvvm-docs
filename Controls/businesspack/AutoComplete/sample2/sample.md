### Sample 2: Changed Event

The `Changed` event can be used to trigger a command in the viewmodel when the value in the control changes.

By default, the `Changed` event is triggered only when the control loses its focus provided the value has been changed. 

However, you can use the `UpdateTextOnInput` property to make the control trigger the event whenever the text inside changes.
