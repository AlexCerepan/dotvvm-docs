## Sample 2: Multiple CheckBoxes

The CheckBox has also a property `CheckedItems` which can bind to any collection. This is an alternative to the `Checked` property - these properties cannot be combined.
The collection will always contain values of the checkboxes which are checked. The value of the checkbox which should be inserted in the collection, is defined in the `CheckedValue` property.

You can also modify the collection contents in the viewmodel code which will update the checkbox check states appropriately.
