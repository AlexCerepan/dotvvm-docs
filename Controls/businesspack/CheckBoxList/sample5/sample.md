## Sample 5: Disabling CheckBoxes

If you need to disable some of the checkboxes, you can use the `ItemEnabledBinding` to determine which checkboxes will be enabled and which will not. By default, all checkboxes are enabled and can be checked or unchecked freely.

The `Enabled` property on the control takes the precedence before the `ItemEnabledBinding`.
