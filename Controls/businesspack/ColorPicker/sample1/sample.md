### Sample 1: Basic Usage

The `SelectedRgbaColor` property should be bound to an object of type `RgbaColor` with the `Red`, `Green`, `Blue` and `Alpha` properties. 
The `Red`, `Green` and `Blue` properties are `byte` (0 - 255), the `Alpha` property is `double` (0 - 1).

The `Placeholder` property specifies a watermark text which is displayed when no color is selected.
