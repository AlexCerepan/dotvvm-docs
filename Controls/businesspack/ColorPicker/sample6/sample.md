## Sample 6: HEX Colors

If you prefer to work with HEX colors, use the `SelectedColor` property instead of the `SelectedRgbaColor` property. We support `#RGB` and `#RRGGBB` color formats (the `#` is optional).

When the `AllowAlphaChannel` property is set to `true`, you can also use `#RGBA` HEX colors.
