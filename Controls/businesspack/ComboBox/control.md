This control is different from the built-in [ComboBox](/docs/controls/builtin/ComboBox/{branch}) and is not derived from it.

The Business Pack `ComboBox` control allows the user to select from a collection of objects in the viewmodel or to search for the items on the server.
Additionally, it allows to have custom templates for the list items.
