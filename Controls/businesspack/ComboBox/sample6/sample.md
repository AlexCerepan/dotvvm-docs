## Sample 6: New Items

To allow entering a custom value which is not present in the `DataSource` collection, you can use the `AllowNewItem` property. 

The `Text` property contains the exact value the user entered in the text field.

This feature can be used only when the `DataSource` collection contains `string` values.
