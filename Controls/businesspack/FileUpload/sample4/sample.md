### Sample 4: Drag & Drop Upload

The drag & drop upload is supported out-of-the-box. And if you need to customize its look and feel, you can use the `DropTemplate` property. It allows you to specify contents visible when user drags files over the `FileUpload` control.

The `DropTemplate` is by default rendered over all contents of the control.
