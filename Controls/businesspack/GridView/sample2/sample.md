## Sample 2: Grid Headers

When the `DataSource` is empty, the grid will not appear at all by default. The `ShowTableWhenNoData` property can be used to make the grid header visible even if there are no data.

The `HeaderCssClass` property of the column sets the CSS class to the column header cell.

To place custom content in the header cell, you can use the `HeaderTemplate` property.
