### Sample 6: Inline Editing

The `InlineEditing` property can be use to enable the user edit rows directly in the grid.

Every column has the `IsEditable` property which specifies whether the column can be edited or not.

The columns also have the `EditTemplate` property which can be used to define a custom edit template for the cell.

The object that is currently being edited, is identified by the `gridViewDataSet.RowEditOptions.EditRowId` property which contains the primary key of the edited object. The name of the property which is a primary key, is stored in `gridViewDataSet.RowEditOptions.PrimaryKeyPropertyName`.
