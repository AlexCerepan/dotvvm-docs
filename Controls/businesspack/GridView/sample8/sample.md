### Sample 8: Advanced Column Types

There are several columns which use various *Business Pack* controls in the insert and edit mode:

* the `GridViewComboBoxColumn` renders a [ComboBox](/docs/controls/businesspack/ComboBox/{branch}) control.

* The `GridViewCheckBoxColumn` renders a [CheckBox](/docs/controls/businesspack/CheckBox/{branch}) control.

The properties of the column have the same names and meaning like the properties of the control inside the cell.
