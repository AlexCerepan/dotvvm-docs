### Sample 9: Row Decorators

The `RowDecorators` property can specify decorators that are applied to individual grid rows. The decorator can add properties or event handlers to the `<tr>` element rendered by the grid.

For the rows in the edit mode, the `EditRowDecorators` are used instead of the default decorator collection.

Similarly, for the rows in the insert mode, the `InsertRowDecorators` are used.
