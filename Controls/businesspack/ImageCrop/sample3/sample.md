### Sample 3: Forced Crop Radius

To make the border radius fixed, the `ForcedCropRadius` property can be used. It expects a value between `0` and `50`. 

`0` means no border radius. `50` means maximum border radius. The value is in percent, so the border radius of `50%` can be used to make a circle.
