### Sample 1: Basic Usage

The `Text` property is binding value of input.

The `Mask` property expects some string input, which defines the data for the control.

The `Placeholder` property works as placeholder on input element.

#### Default Patterns

If you do not set the `Patterns` property, like in this example, MaskedTextBox uses the default patterns:

 - 0 - Digit. Accepts any digit between 0 and 9.
 - 9 - Digit or space. Accepts any digit between 0 and 9 or space.
 - \# - Digit or space. Identical to Rule 9. In addition, allows the + (plus) and - (minus) signs.
 - L - Letter. Restricts the input to a-z and A-Z letters. This rule is equivalent to [a-zA-Z] in regular expressions.
 - ? - Letter or space. Restricts the input to letters a-z and A-Z. This rule is equivalent to [a-zA-Z]|\s in regular expressions.
 - & - Character. Accepts any character except a space. The rule is equivalent to \S in regular expressions.
 - C - Character or space. Accepts any character. The rule is equivalent to . in regular expressions.
 - A - Alphanumeric. Accepts letters and digits only.
 - a - Alphanumeric or space. Accepts only letters, digits, and space.
