Creates a `div` element styled as a modal dialog that can be shown or hidden any time. 

When the dialog is displayed, the content behind it is covered by a semi-transparent backdrop and thus cannot be interacted with.

The *Business Pack* includes also the [Window](/docs/controls/businesspack/Window/{branch}) which can display a similar window but keeps the content behind unlocked.
