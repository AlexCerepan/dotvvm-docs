### Sample 4: Dialog Size

The `Width` and `Height` properties can be used to specify fixed dimensions of the dialog. You can use any CSS units here - e.g. `400px`, `50%` etc.

To let the user resize the dialog, set the `AllowResize` property to `true`.

The `MinWidth` and `MinHeight` properties can restrict the minimum dimensions of the dialog. They are always in pixels.
