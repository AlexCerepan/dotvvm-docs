### Sample 1: Basic Usage

The content inside the `<bp:Panel>` element is treated as a `ContentTemplate` property which specifies the main content of the panel.

The `HeaderText` can be used to specify the text in the panel header. Alternatively, you can use the `HeaderTemplate` property to be able to use rich HTML content inside the header.

The same applies to the `FooterText` and `FooterTemplate` properties which can be used to customize the panel footer row.
