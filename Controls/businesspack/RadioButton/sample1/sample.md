### Sample 1: Basic RadioButtons

The RadioButton control has the `Checked` property of *boolean* which indicates whether the control is checked or not.

Optionally, you can use the `Text` property to specify the label for the radio button. Or you can put the label contents inside the `bp:RadioButton` element.
