## Sample 2: Tab Key

The `ActiveTabKey` property specifies a key of the tab which is currently selected. The key of a tab is automatically generated by default. But you can override it by setting the `Key` property. The data-binding works in both ways, so it is possible to switch the tabs by changing the viewmodel property bound to `ActiveTabKey`.

The `ActiveTabChanged` event specifies a command in the viewmodel which is triggered when the user switches the tab.
