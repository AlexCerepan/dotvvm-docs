Creates a `div` element styled as a window that can be shown or hidden any time. 

The content behind the window remains unlocked and the window can be dragged freely to any place in the page.

*DotVVM Business Pack* includes also the [ModalDialog](/docs/controls/businesspack/ModalDialog/{branch}) which can display a similar window but prevents the user to interact with the content behind the dialog.
