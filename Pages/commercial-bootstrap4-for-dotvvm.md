# Installing Bootstrap for DotVVM

To use the [Bootstrap for DotVVM](/landing/bootstrap-for-dotvvm) controls, you have use the [DotVVM Private Nuget Feed](/docs/tutorials/commercial-dotvvm-private-nuget-feed).

1. Install the `DotVVM.Controls.Bootstrap4` package from the DotVVM Private Nuget Feed.

2. Open your `DotvvmStartup.cs` file and add the following line at the beginning of the `Configure` method.

```CSHARP
config.AddBootstrap4Configuration();
``` 

You might need to add the following `using` at the beginning of the file.

```CSHARP
using DotVVM.Framework.Controls.Bootstrap4;
```

This will register all Bootstrap controls under the `<bs:*` tag prefix, and it also registers several Bootstrap resources. 



## Configuration

The [Bootstrap for DotVVM](/landing/bootstrap-for-dotvvm) package includes Bootstrap CSS and JavaScript libraries. You can replace them with your own ones.
 
If you have already included the Bootstrap script and styles using the `<script>` and `<style>` elements in the page header (e.g. in the master page), you can tell 
DotVVM that it should not render the default Bootstrap resources. Add this in the `DotvvmStartup.cs`:

```CSHARP
config.AddBootstrap4Configuration(new DotvvmBootstrapOptions() 
{
    IncludeBootstrapResourcesInPage = false
});
```

Optionally, you can also tell DotVVM not to include jQuery. 

```CSHARP
config.AddBootstrap4Configuration(new DotvvmBootstrapOptions() 
{
    IncludeJQueryResourceInPage = false
});
```

### Is It OK?

To verify that Bootstrap resources are included correctly, press F12 in your web browser. Verify that bootstrap.css or bootstrap.js is not loaded twice, and there are 
no errors in the developer console, especially some messages which say that some Bootstrap-related resource could not be found.

## Limitations

The current version of [Bootstrap for DotVVM](/landing/bootstrap-for-dotvvm) supports **Bootstrap 4**. For more information about Bootstrap, navigate into its [documentation](https://getbootstrap.com).
