## Create a new project (ASP.NET 5 aka DNX)

**DotVVM** will support the DNX and new .NET Core environments however we are not ready for the complete switch yet.
After version 1.0 is out, we'll be able to publish the DNX version too.


If you can't wait, you can build the DNX version yourself from the (dotnetcore branch on our GitHub)[https://github.com/riganti/dotvvm/tree/dotnetcore].
It lacks recent features and updates of DotVVM, however you can help us with merging those two branches.
